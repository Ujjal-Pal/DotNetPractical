# DotNetPractical - ColorShape
Given is a CSV file with a list of objects having the following attributes - shape (like ball, 
pyramid) and color. Write an algorithm which will produce output CSV file having records 
ordered in a way that objects of the same color have a maximum distance between them.

For example, if number of objects is 7 and R=red, B= blue and source list is RRBBRRB -> 
RBRBRBR so you want to spread them as evenly as possible
